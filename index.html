      <h3>Listening to music</h3>
      <p>What is music? Music is the art or science of combining vocal or instrumental sounds (sometimes both) to produce beauty of form, harmony, and expression of emotion. As a teenager, I listen to music everyday.  Listening to music takes the stress away from my mind. . I cannot go a day without listening to music.Music is just that good... I love classic musics.. Composers I listen to are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rb0UmrCXxVA">Mozart</a>,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-fFHeTX70Q">Beethoven</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JQm5aSjX6g">Bach</a> .  Music is my passion. While I am writing this, I am listening to music. I cannot help myself. Some people are addicted to drugs and alcohol but my addiction is music </p>

      <h3>Playing video games</h3>
      <p>Playing video games is a great way to de-stress from the demands of everyday life and do something that you enjoy just for the sake of enjoying it.Whether itâ€™s a realistic video game like <a href="https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/10-reasons-why-adults-who-play-video-games-are-happier.html">Tomb Raider</a> or a highly imaginative video game like World of Warcraft, using your imagination to put yourself in the mindset of your character and their world is a highly stimulating, creative exercise for your brain.</p>

      <h3>Reading</h3>
      <p>Though all hobbies have their own merits and demerits in their own ways, reading is one which has more of merits than demerits. I would personally recommend that all of us should cultivate the habit of reading as there is no other better source of keeping one aware and out of being fooled when you have the knowledge of the fact what you need to know. Reading is a great hobby that I am proud to be possessing and I am just in love with it. </p>

      <h3>Bodybuilding</h3>
      <p>I love bodybuilding now, it has done so much for me. Every day its something that reminds me that I'm different, in a good way.I love this sport because it give confidence and self esteem. It turns boys into men and girls into women. You also don't have to quit when you get old. This is a sport for everyone.</p>
